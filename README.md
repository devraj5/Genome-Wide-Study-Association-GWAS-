# Genome-Wide-Study-Association-GWAS-
A tool to discover statistically significant SNPs (genetic varinats) associated with Disease. 
If certain genetic variations are found to be significantly more frequent in people with the disease compared to people without disease, the variations are said to be "associated" with the disease.
Hence such study can serve as a powerful tool to develop better strategies to detect, treat and prevent the disease.
Health professionals will be able to use such tool to provide patients with individualized information about their risks of developing certain diseases.
Also in the current scenario of one size-fits-all approach to medical care, such research can lay the groundwork for the era of personalized medicine.
